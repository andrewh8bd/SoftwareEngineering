Soooooo, Things that need to be installed are:
MinGW (mingw.org)
GLFW (glfw.org) Take the move the glfw lib to MinGW/lib, and glfw.h to
    MinGW/include/GL
GLU
GLEE (opengl.org/sdk/libs/GLee/) Download the latest, move GLEE lib to MinGW/lib    and GLEE.h to MinGW/include/GL 

The Software Development Strategy that we plan on using is Extreme Programming.

In the mean time, we should start getting the base game framework together, and such. This means getting a graphics framework together, a sound framework together, and a scripting framework together.

The graphics framework will contain all things that have to do with graphics calls, transformations, GUI, etc.

The sound framework will contain all things that have to do with sound calls, background music, sound effects, etc.

The scripting system will allow us to test many different game things without recompile, such as levels, characters, music, enemies, etc.
