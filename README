Soooooo, Things that need to be installed are:
MinGW (mingw.org)
GLFW (glfw.org) Take the move the glfw lib to MinGW/lib, and glfw.h to
    MinGW/include/GL
GLU
GLEE (opengl.org/sdk/libs/GLee/) Download the latest, move GLEE lib to MinGW/lib    and GLEE.h to MinGW/include/GL 
Boost (Don't know exactly yet, since I don't have it downloaded and installed
    quite yet. More information later.)

The Software Development Strategy that we plan on using is Extreme Programming.
