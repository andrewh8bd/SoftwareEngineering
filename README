Soooooo, Things that need to be installed are:
MinGW (mingw.org)
GLFW (glfw.org) Take the move the glfw lib to MinGW/lib, and glfw.h to
    MinGW/include/GL
GLU
GLEE (opengl.org/sdk/libs/GLee/) Download the latest, move GLEE lib to MinGW/lib    and GLEE.h to MinGW/include/GL 
CXX Test (This will be for the required unit testing) (cxxtest.tigris.org)

The Software Development Strategy that we plan on using is Unified Process :D

The customer wants a 2D sidescroller game, but they don't have any details on
graphics, or game mechanics yet. They will get back to us ASAP.

Details from customer: They want a 2D platformer, shooter, RPG style side scroller. If this confuses you think Mario+Contra+Champions of Norrath.

The graphics framework will contain all things that have to do with graphics calls, transformations, GUI, etc.

The sound framework will contain all things that have to do with sound calls, background music, sound effects, etc.

The physics framework will contain all things that have to do with physics calls, etc.

The scripting system will allow us to test many different game things without recompile, such as levels, characters, music, enemies, etc.
